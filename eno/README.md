Look, we all want Brian to come over for a cup of tea as we bask in the infinite melodies of his dulcet tones, 
ephemeral, generative oscillations conjured from his synapses.

...but that's not going to happen. 

The best we can do is create approximations to Brian.\
Such that the patient listener might sit at home and be lulled into a false sense of belief,\
that maybe Brian is really visiting, across the vast landscapes of waves separating us all.\
Perhaps a small fractal of a vibration of sound reaching us through the compressions and rarefactions of our eardrums
emanated from the man himself.

We can take comfort in this.\
As we're blanketed in a slowly enveloping wall of sound.\
That the outside world becomes a mere memory.\
The whole universe is revealed to us.\
And we are safe.\
Safe in Brian's hands.

## Building
Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:matthewh806/Stridulation.git
```
Navigate to the eno directory `cd Stridulation/eno`

Run these two commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a local server at 0.0.0.0 port=8000

## Credits
For this project first and foremost I would like to credit Brian Eno, without whom none of this would've been possible.
I made use of [tonejs](https://tonejs.github.io/) and [nouislider](https://refreshless.com/nouislider/)

The inspiration for this project comes from a great blog post called [Javascript Systems Music](http://teropa.info/blog/2016/07/28/javascript-systems-music.html#the-notes-and-intervals-in-music-for-airports) by Tero Parviainen,
so if you're interested in what you hear here, audio, programming and experimental music (or all!) its well worth a read.
